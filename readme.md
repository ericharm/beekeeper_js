## Up and running
-----------------

git clone https://e_e_harm@bitbucket.org/e_e_harm/beekeeper_js.github

cd beekeeper_js

npm install

npm install -g nodemon browserify

npm test

npm start

npm run open or navigate to: http://localhost:8081


## Framework
------------

### server.js
The framework runs on Express, so you can go in here to connect your game to a database or configure the setup for the server.

### public/js/index.js
Connects the framework to the browser.  The main loop lives here; it simply calls game.tick() on a fixed timestep.  The framerate is set in this file.  Browser events are passed from here into the game.  The base setup accepts keyboard input, but support for mouse and joystick will come along soon.

## src/

### config/
Mostly objects which reference constants, like keyCodes, colors, frameRate, and resource paths.

### controllers/
Classes to convert input into commands which can control scene nodes or other parts of the application.

### lib/
Bedrock of the framework that is unlikely to need much change.

### models/
In-game objects and classes to support them.

### states/
Objects that live on the state stack, like main menu, game, and pause.

### views/
Scripts to handle specialized render logic, like animations and special effects.


## Inspiration
--------------
The architecture of the framework is inspired by the book _[SFML Game Development](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/sfml-game-development)_ by Jan Haller, Henrik Vogelius Hansson, Artur Moreira.

Scene Nodes (and eventually Game States) utilize the [Mozart](https://github.com/philipwalton/mozart) library.


## To Do
--------
-Class for managing the View and Viewport

-Collision detection system

-Animation system

-Audio support

-Write tests
